    <h1 class="title">Poaceae</h1>
    <p>
      Poaceae (/poʊˈeɪsiaɪ/) or Gramineae (/ɡrəˈmɪniaɪ/) is a large and nearly
      ubiquitous family of monocotyledonous flowering plants known as grasses.
      It includes the cereal grasses, bamboos and the grasses of natural
      grassland and species cultivated in lawns and pasture. The latter are
      commonly referred to collectively as grass. With around 780 genera and
      around 12,000 species,[4] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family,
      following the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae.[5] The
      Poaceae are the most economically important plant family, providing staple
      foods from domesticated cereal crops such as maize, wheat, rice, barley,
      and millet as well as feed for meat-producing animals. They provide,
      through direct human consumption, just over one-half (51%) of all dietary
      energy; rice provides 20%, wheat supplies 20%, maize (corn) 5.5%, and
      other grains 6%.[6] Some members of the Poaceae are used as building
      materials (bamboo, thatch, and straw); others can provide a source of
      biofuel, primarily via the conversion of maize to ethanol. Grasses have
      stems that are hollow except at the nodes and narrow alternate leaves
      borne in two ranks. The lower part of each leaf encloses the stem, forming
      a leaf-sheath. The leaf grows from the base of the blade, an adaptation
      allowing it to cope with frequent grazing. Grasslands such as savannah and
      prairie where grasses are dominant are estimated to constitute 40.5% of
      the land area of the Earth, excluding Greenland and Antarctica.[7] Grasses
      are also an important part of the vegetation in many other habitats,
      including wetlands, forests and tundra. Though they are commonly called
      "grasses", seagrasses, rushes, and sedges fall outside this family. The
      rushes and sedges are related to the Poaceae, being members of the order
      Poales, but the seagrasses are members of order Alismatales.
    </p>
    <h1>Etymology</h1>
    <p>
      The name Poaceae was given by John Hendley Barnhart in 1895,[8]:7 based on
      the tribe Poeae described in 1814 by Robert Brown, and the type genus Poa
      described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus. The term is derived from the Ancient
      Greek πόα (póa, "fodder").
    </p>
    <h1>Evolutionary history</h1>
    <p>
      Grasses include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became
      widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous period, and fossilized
      dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing phytoliths of a
      variety that include grasses that are related to modern rice and
      bamboo.[9] Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry
      deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are currently
      the most widespread plant type; grass is a valuable source of food and
      energy for all sorts of wildlife and organics. A cladogram shows
      subfamilies and approximate species numbers in brackets:[10] Before 2005,
      fossil findings indicated that grasses evolved around 55 million years
      ago. Findings of grass-like phytoliths in Cretaceous dinosaur coprolites
      from the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) aged Lameta Formation of India
      have pushed this date back to 66 million years ago.[11][12] In 2011,
      revised dating of the origins of the rice tribe Oryzeae due to findings
      from the same deposit suggested a date as early as 107 to 129 Mya.[13] Wu,
      You & Li (2018) described grass microfossils extracted from a specimen of
      the hadrosauroid dinosaur Equijubus normani from the Early Cretaceous
      (Albian) Zhonggou Formation (China), which were found to belong to
      primitive lineages within Poaceae, similar in position to the
      Anomochlooideae. The authors noted that India became separated from
      Antarctica, and therefore also all other continents, approximately at the
      beginning of late Aptian, so the presence of grasses in both India and
      China during the Cretaceous indicates that the ancestor of Indian grasses
      must have existed before late Aptian. Wu, You & Li considered the
      Barremian origin for grasses to be probable.[1] The relationships among
      the three subfamilies Bambusoideae, Oryzoideae and Pooideae in the BOP
      clade have been resolved: Bambusoideae and Pooideae are more closely
      related to each other than to Oryzoideae.[14] This separation occurred
      within the relatively short time span of about 4 million years. According
      to Lester Charles King the spread of grasses in the Late Cenozoic would
      have changed patterns of hillslope evolution favouring slopes that are
      convex upslope and concave downslope and lacking a free face were common.
      King argued that this was the result of more slowly acting surface wash
      caused by carpets of grass which in turn would have resulted in relatively
      more soil creep.[15][16]

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      Grasses may be annual or perennial herbs,[17]:10 generally with the
      following characteristics (the image gallery can be used for reference):
      The stems of grasses, called culms, are usually cylindrical (more rarely
      flattened, but not 3-angled) and are hollow, plugged at the nodes, where
      the leaves are attached.[17][18] Grass leaves are nearly always alternate
      and distichous (in one plane), and have parallel veins.[17]:11 Each leaf
      is differentiated into a lower sheath hugging the stem and a blade with
      entire (i.e., smooth) margins.[17]:11 The leaf blades of many grasses are
      hardened with silica phytoliths, which discourage grazing animals; some,
      such as sword grass, are sharp enough to cut human skin. A membranous
      appendage or fringe of hairs called the ligule lies at the junction
      between sheath and blade, preventing water or insects from penetrating
      into the sheath.[17]:11 Flowers of Poaceae are characteristically arranged
      in spikelets, each having one or more florets.[17]:12 The spikelets are
      further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that
      bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or
      sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed by one or
      more florets.[17]:13 A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two
      bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are
      usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and mainly
      anemophilous or wind-pollinated, although insects occasionally play a
      role.[19] The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules,[17]:11
      that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are
      generally interpreted to be modified sepals. The fruit of grasses is a
      caryopsis, in which the seed coat is fused to the fruit wall.[17]:16 A
      tiller is a leafy shoot other than the first shoot produced from the
      seed.[17]:11
    </p>
    <h1>Growth and development</h1>
    <p>
      Grass blades grow at the base of the blade and not from elongated stem
      tips. This low growth point evolved in response to grazing animals and
      allows grasses to be grazed or mown regularly without severe damage to the
      plant.[20]:113–114 Three general classifications of growth habit present
      in grasses: bunch-type (also called caespitose), stoloniferous, and
      rhizomatous.[citation needed] The success of the grasses lies in part in
      their morphology and growth processes and in part in their physiological
      diversity. There are both C3 and C4 grasses, referring to the
      photosynthetic pathway for carbon fixation. The C4 grasses have a
      photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which
      allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering them better adapted
      to hot, arid environments. The C3 grasses are referred to as "cool-season"
      grasses, while the C4 plants are considered "warm-season"
      grasses.[17]:18–19 Annual cool-season – wheat, rye, annual bluegrass
      (annual meadowgrass, Poa annua), and oat Perennial cool-season –
      orchardgrass (cocksfoot, Dactylis glomerata), fescue (Festuca spp.),
      Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) Annual
      warm-season – maize, sudangrass, and pearl millet Perennial warm-season –
      big bluestem, Indiangrass, Bermudagrass and switchgrass. Although the C4
      species are all in the PACMAD clade (see diagram above), it seems that
      various forms of C4 have arisen some twenty or more times, in various
      subfamilies or genera. In the Aristida genus for example, one species (A.
      longifolia) is C3 but the approximately 300 other species are C4. As
      another example, the whole tribe of Andropogoneae, which includes maize,
      sorghum, sugar cane, "Job's tears", and bluestem grasses, is C4.[10]
    </p>
    <h1>Distribution</h1>
    <p>
      The grass family is one of the most widely distributed and abundant groups
      of plants on Earth. Grasses are found on every continent,[21][22]
      including Antarctica with the presence of Antarctic hair grass on the
      Antarctic Peninsula.
    </p>
    <h1>Ecology</h1>
    <p>
      Grasses are the dominant vegetation in many habitats, including grassland,
      salt-marsh, reedswamp and steppes. They also occur as a smaller part of
      the vegetation in almost every other terrestrial habitat.[citation needed]
      Grass-dominated biomes are called grasslands. If only large, contiguous
      areas of grasslands are counted, these biomes cover 31% of the planet's
      land.[23] Grasslands include pampas, steppes, and prairies.[24] Grasses
      provide food to many grazing mammals—such as livestock, deer, and
      elephants—as well as to many species of butterflies and moths.[citation
      needed] Many types of animals eat grass as their main source of food, and
      are called graminivores – these include cattle, sheep, horses, rabbits and
      many invertebrates, such as grasshoppers and the caterpillars of many
      brown butterflies. Grasses are also eaten by omnivorous or even
      occasionally by primarily carnivorous animals. Grasses are unusual in that
      the meristem is near the bottom of the plant; hence, grasses can quickly
      recover from cropping at the top.[25] The evolution of large grazing
      animals in the Cenozoic contributed to the spread of grasses. Without
      large grazers, fire-cleared areas are quickly colonized by grasses, and
      with enough rain, tree seedlings. Trees eventually outcompete most
      grasses. Trampling grazers kill seedling trees but not grasses.[20]:137
    </p>
    <h1>Taxonomy</h1>
    <p>
      There are about 12,000 grass species in about 771 genera that are
      classified into 12 subfamilies.[26] See the full list of Poaceae genera.
      Anomochlooideae Pilg. ex Potztal, a small lineage of broad-leaved grasses
      that includes two genera (Anomochloa, Streptochaeta) Pharoideae L.G.Clark
      & Judz., a small lineage of grasses of three genera, including Pharus and
      Leptaspis Puelioideae L.G.Clark, M.Kobay., S.Mathews, Spangler &
      E.A.Kellogg, a small lineage of the African genus Puelia Pooideae,
      including wheat, barley, oats, brome-grass (Bromus), reed-grasses
      (Calamagrostis) and many lawn and pasture grasses such as bluegrass (Poa)
      Setaria verticillata from Panicoideae Tragus roxburghii from Chloridoideae
      Bambusoideae, including bamboo Ehrhartoideae, including rice and wild rice
      Aristidoideae, including Aristida Arundinoideae, including giant reed and
      common reed Chloridoideae, including the lovegrasses (Eragrostis, about
      350 species, including teff), dropseeds (Sporobolus, some 160 species),
      finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.), and the muhly grasses
      (Muhlenbergia, about 175 species) Panicoideae, including panic grass,
      maize, sorghum, sugarcane, most millets, fonio, "Job's tears", and
      bluestem grasses Micrairoideae Danthonioideae, including pampas grass

    <h1>Uses</h1>
    <p>
      Grasses are, in human terms, perhaps the most economically important plant
      family. Their economic importance stems from several areas, including food
      production, industry, and lawns. They have been grown as food for
      domesticated animals for up to 6,000 years and the grains of grasses such
      as wheat, rice, maize (corn) and barley have been the most important human
      food crops. Grasses are also used in the manufacture of thatch, paper,
      fuel, clothing, insulation, timber for fencing, furniture, scaffolding and
      construction materials, floor matting, sports turf and baskets.
    </p>
    <h1>Food production</h1>
    <p>
      Agricultural grasses grown for their edible seeds are called cereals or
      grains (although the latter term, agriculturally, refers to both cereals
      and legumes). Of all crops grown, 70% are grasses.[27] Three cereals—rice,
      wheat, and maize (corn)—provide more than half of all calories consumed by
      humans.[28] Cereals constitute the major source of carbohydrates for
      humans and perhaps the major source of protein, including rice (in
      southern and eastern Asia), maize (in Central and South America), and
      wheat and barley (in Europe, northern Asia and the Americas). Sugarcane is
      the major source of sugar production. Additional food uses of sugarcane
      include sprouted grain, shoots, and rhizomes, and in drink they include
      sugarcane juice and plant milk, as well as rum, beer, whisky, and vodka.
      Bamboo shoots are used in numerous Asian dishes and broths, and are
      available in supermarkets in various sliced forms, in both fresh,
      fermented and canned versions. Lemongrass is a grass used as a culinary
      herb for its citrus-like flavor and scent. Many species of grass are grown
      as pasture for foraging or as fodder for prescribed livestock feeds,
      particularly in the case of cattle, horses, and sheep. Such grasses may be
      cut and stored for later feeding, especially for the winter, in the form
      of bales of hay or straw, or in silos as silage. Straw (and sometimes hay)
      may also be used as bedding for animals.
    </p>
    <h1>Industry</h1>
    <p>
      Grasses are used as raw material for a multitude of purposes, including
      construction and in the composition of building materials such as cob, for
      insulation, in the manufacture of paper and board such as Oriented
      structural straw board. Grass fiber can be used for making paper, and for
      biofuel production.[citation needed]Bamboo scaffolding is able to
      withstand typhoon-force winds that would break steel scaffolding.[23]
      Larger bamboos and Arundo donax have stout culms that can be used in a
      manner similar to timber, Arundo is used to make reeds for woodwind
      instruments, and bamboo is used for innumerable implements.[citation
      needed] Phragmites australis (common reed) is important for thatching and
      grass roots stabilize the sod of sod houses.[citation needed] Reeds are
      used in water treatment systems, in wetland conservation and land
      reclamation in Afro-Eurasia.[citation needed] Marram grass (Ammophila
      arenaria)
    </p>
    <h1>Lawn and ornamental use</h1>
    <p>
      Grasses are the primary plant used in lawns, which themselves derive from
      grazed grasslands in Europe.[citation needed] They also provide an
      important means of erosion control (e.g., along roadsides), especially on
      sloping land.[citation needed] Grass lawns are an important covering of
      playing surfaces in many sports, including football (soccer), American
      football, tennis, golf, cricket, softball and baseball. Ornamental
      grasses, such as perennial bunch grasses, are used in many styles of
      garden design for their foliage, inflorescences, seed heads. They are
      often used in natural landscaping, xeriscaping and slope stabilization in
      contemporary landscaping, wildlife gardening, and native plant
      gardening.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <h1>Sports turf</h1>
    <p>
      Grass playing fields, courses and pitches are the traditional playing
      surfaces for many sports, including American football, association
      football, baseball, cricket, golf, and rugby. Grass surfaces are also
      sometimes used for horse racing and tennis. Type of maintenance and
      species of grass used may be important factors for some sports, less
      critical for others. In some sports facilities, including indoor domes and
      other places where maintenance of a grass field would be difficult, grass
      may be replaced with artificial turf, a synthetic grass-like
      substitute.[29]

      <br /><br />Cricket The gray area is the cricket pitch currently in use.
      Parallel to it are other pitches in various states of preparation which
      could be used in other matches. Main article: Cricket pitch § Preparation
      and maintenance of the playing area In cricket, the pitch is the strip of
      carefully mowed and rolled grass where the bowler bowls. In the days
      leading up to the match it is repeatedly mowed and rolled to produce a
      very hard, flat surface for the ball to bounce off.[30]

      <br /><br />Golf Main article: Golf course Grass on golf courses is kept
      in three distinct conditions: that of the rough, the fairway, and the
      putting green. Grass on the fairway is mown short and even, allowing the
      player to strike the ball cleanly. Playing from the rough is a
      disadvantage because the long grass may affect the flight of the ball.
      Grass on the putting green is the shortest and most even, ideally allowing
      the ball to roll smoothly over the surface. An entire industry revolves
      around the development and marketing of grass varieties for golf
      courses.[citation needed]

      <br /><br />Tennis Main article: Grass court In tennis, grass is grown on
      very hard-packed soil, and the bounce of a tennis ball may vary depending
      on the grass's health, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and
      tear of recent play.[citation needed] The surface is softer than hard
      courts and clay (other tennis surfaces), so the ball bounces lower, and
      players must reach the ball faster resulting in a different style of play
      which may suit some players more than others.[citation needed] Among the
      world's most prestigious court for grass tennis is Centre Court at
      Wimbledon, London which hosts the final of the annual Wimbledon
      Championships in England, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments.
    </p>
    <h1>Role in society</h1>
    <p>
      Grasses have long had significance in human society. They have been
      cultivated as feed for people and domesticated animals for thousands of
      years. The primary ingredient of beer is usually barley or wheat, both of
      which have been used for this purpose for over 4,000 years.[citation
      needed] In some places, particularly in suburban areas, the maintenance of
      a grass lawn is a sign of a homeowner's responsibility to the overall
      appearance of their neighborhood. One work credits lawn maintenance to:
      ...the desire for upward mobility and its manifestation in the lawn. As
      Virginia Jenkins, author of The Lawn, put it quite bluntly, 'Upper
      middle-class Americans emulated aristocratic society with their own small,
      semi-rural estates.' In general, the lawn was one of the primary selling
      points of these new suburban homes, as it shifted social class
      designations from the equity and ubiquity of urban homes connected to the
      streets with the upper-middle class designation of a "healthy" green space
      and the status symbol that is the front lawn.[31][32] Many US
      municipalities and homeowners' associations have rules which require lawns
      to be maintained to certain specifications, sanctioning those who allow
      the grass to grow too long. In communities with drought problems, watering
      of lawns may be restricted to certain times of day or days of the
      week.[33] The smell of the freshly cut grass is produced mainly by
      cis-3-Hexenal.[34] Some common aphorisms involve grass. For example: "The
      grass is always greener on the other side" suggests an alternate state of
      affairs will always seem preferable to one's own. "Don't let the grass
      grow under your feet" tells someone to get moving. "A snake in the grass"
      means dangers that are hidden. "When elephants fight, it is the grass
      which suffers" tells of bystanders caught in the crossfire. A folk myth
      about grass is that it refuses to grow where any violent death has
      occurred.[35]
